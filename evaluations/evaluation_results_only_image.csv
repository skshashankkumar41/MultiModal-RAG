compare Gopher and Chinchilla models wrt zero shot few shot," In the provided image, there is a table with three categories: GPT-3 (zero shot), GPT-3 (few shot), and Chinchilla. The table lists different benchmarks such as LXMERTA, ROVER, ANTOVER, and others, with corresponding accuracy percentages for each model.

According to the image, the Chinchilla model outperforms both GPT-3 in zero shot and GPT-3 in few shot settings across all benchmarks. The Chinchilla model achieves higher accuracy percentages than GPT-3 in both zero shot and few shot for each benchmark.

For example, the Chinchilla model has 80% accuracy on LXMERTA with zero shots, while GPT-3 has 40%. In the few shot setting, Chinchilla also achieves higher accuracy, with 65% compared to 25% for GPT-3.

Similarly, across all benchmarks, the Chinchilla model consistently has higher percentages than both zero and few shot GPT-3.

humaneval and MBPP for llama and palm models," The textual context indicates that the image you provided is a table from a research paper or study related to natural language processing (NLP) or machine learning, specifically focusing on performance metrics for language models.

The table presents results for two models: ""llama"" and ""palm."" For both models, there are separate rows showing performance metrics for three different tasks: ""gender,"" ""religion/color,"" and ""sexual orientation."" These rows include numerical values that represent the accuracy or performance of the models on each task.

Given this information, I can provide you with the humaneval and MBPP scores for the llama model as well as the palm model:

- For the llama model, the humaneval score for gender is 69.6%, the score for religion/color is 71.3%, and the score for sexual orientation is 71.2%.
- For the palm model, the humaneval score for gender is 64.0%, the score for religion/color is 63.6%, and the score for sexual orientation is 65.4%.

Please note that MBPP scores are not provided in this table, as the image only shows the textual context and not the specific values for each model. Additionally, if you're looking for a specific metric (like humaneval or MBPP) for either llama or palm models on a particular task, it would be found under the appropriate column in the table.
