compare Gopher and Chinchilla models wrt zero shot few shot," The table in the image shows the performance of different models on a task that requires zero-shot reasoning and few-shot learning. According to the given context, Gopher has worse perplexity scores than Chinchilla for both zero-shot and few-shot tasks, indicating that Chinchilla generally performs better in these settings. Specifically, for the zero-shot scenario, the perplexity score for Chinchilla is 55.4 - 64.1, while for Gopher it is 280B 43.5 - 57.0. For the few-shot scenario, Chinchilla's performance ranges from 55.4 - 64.1 to 55.4 - 64.6, whereas Gopher's scores are 57.2 and 57.2 - 64.3. It's worth noting that the performance of Chinchilla is more consistent across different settings compared to Gopher. ","['Scores\nwere obtained using the PerplexityAPI, with higher\nscore indicating more toxic generations.\nwith the size of the model, especially for Respect-\nful prompts. This was also observed in previous\nwork (Zhang et al., 2022), with the notable excep-\ntion of Hoffmann et al. (2022) where they do not\nsee a difference between Chinchilla and Gopher,\ndespite different sizes. This could be explained by\nthe fact that the larger model, Gopher, has worse\nperformance than Chinchilla, suggesting that the\nrelation between toxicity and model size may only\napply within a model family.'

GPT3 and llama Truthful comparison ," The image you've provided appears to be a table from an academic paper or article, which seems to compare the performance of GPT-3 and LLama on various tasks. However, without specific data points or numerical values visible in the image, it is not possible for me to provide accurate information about their relative performance on these tasks. The textual context you've provided does mention that ""GPT-3 outperforms GPT-3 on this benchmark,"" suggesting that there is a comparison being made between the two models.

To answer your question accurately, I would need to see the actual numbers from Table 16 of the appendix, which likely contain the performance metrics for both GPT-3 and LLama. If you can provide those details or clarify the specific data points you're inquiring about, I would be able to give a more precise answer regarding the truthful comparison between GPT-3 and LLama based on the table's contents.
