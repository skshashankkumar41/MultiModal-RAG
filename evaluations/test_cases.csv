compare Gopher and Chinchilla models wrt zero shot few shot,"Chinchilla consistently outperforms Gopher in the given scenarios based on the table. In zero-shot performance, Chinchilla scores 16.6 compared to Gopher's 10.1. For five-shot performance, Chinchilla achieves a score of 31.5, surpassing Gopher's 24.5. Similarly, in the sixty-four-shot scenario, Chinchilla scores 35.5, while Gopher scores 28.2. One-shot performance data is not available for either model in the table. Overall, Chinchilla demonstrates superior performance across all provided shot scenarios."
humaneval and MBPP for llama and palm models,"The table shows that PaLM with 540 billion parameters performs the best on HumanEval with a pass@1 score of 26.2 and on MBPP with pass@1 and pass@80 scores of 36.8 and 75.0, respectively. LLaMA with 65 billion parameters follows closely, achieving the highest pass@100 score on HumanEval (79.3) and competitive scores on MBPP (37.7 for pass@1 and 76.8 for pass@80). Larger models generally outperform smaller ones in code generation tasks."
GPT3 and llama Truthful comparison ,"The table compares the performance of GPT-3 and LLaMA models on the TruthfulQA benchmark, which measures the fraction of truthful and truthfulinformative answers. GPT-3 models with 1.3B, 6B, and 175B parameters show lower performance, with Truthful scores of 0.31, 0.22, and 0.28, and TruthfulInformative scores of 0.19, 0.19, and 0.25, respectively. In contrast, LLaMA models demonstrate superior results, with Truthful scores increasing from 0.33 to 0.57 and Truthful*Informative scores rising from 0.29 to 0.53 as the parameter count grows from 7B to 65B. This suggests that larger LLaMA models provide more truthful and informative answers compared to their GPT-3 counterparts."
