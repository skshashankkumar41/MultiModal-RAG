compare Gopher and Chinchilla models wrt zero shot few shot," According to the provided textual context, Gopher has a lower score than Chinchilla for 0-shot, 1-shot, and 5-shot settings. However, for 64-shot, Gopher has a higher score than Chinchilla. This suggests that Gopher performs better than Chinchilla when more training data is available during inference, while Chinchilla may have an advantage in scenarios with limited training data.

Based on the table image provided, we can see that for the 0-shot setting, Gopher has a score of around 57.0, while Chinchilla has a score of around 64.1. For the 1-shot and 5-shot settings, Gopher's score is lower than Chinchilla's score, which is consistent with the textual context provided earlier. However, for the 64-shot setting, Gopher's score is higher than Chinchilla's score.

Overall, it appears that Gopher may have an advantage over Chinchilla when there is a large amount of training data available during inference, while Chinchilla may perform better with limited training data.

humaneval and MBPP for llama and palm models," In the context provided, HumanEval is a platform that trains instruct models using large language models such as OPT, GLM, PaLM, PaLM-cont, Chinchilla, LLaMA, OPT-IML-Max, Flan-T5-XXL, Flan-PaLM, and Flan-PaLM-cont. These models receive a description of the program in a few sentences and a few input-output examples.

GPT3 and llama Truthful comparison ," From the provided textual context, it can be concluded that LLaMA-I (65B) outperforms GPT code-davinci-002 on MMLU but is still far from state-of-the-art performance of 77.4. The table in the appendix shows the performance of various models on different benchmarks, including MMLU.

In terms of performance during training, GPT-3 has a steady improvement in performance on most question answering and common sense benchmarks, with a strong correlation between training perplexity and performance.
