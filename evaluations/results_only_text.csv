compare Gopher and Chinchilla models wrt zero shot few shot,"Chinchilla consistently outperforms Gopher in the given scenarios based on the table. In zero-shot performance, Chinchilla scores 16.6 compared to Gopher's 10.1. For five-shot performance, Chinchilla achieves a score of 31.5, surpassing Gopher's 24.5. Similarly, in the sixty-four-shot scenario, Chinchilla scores 35.5, while Gopher scores 28.2. One-shot performance data is not available for either model in the table. Overall, Chinchilla demonstrates superior performance across all provided shot scenarios."," According to the provided textual context, Gopher has a lower score than Chinchilla for 0-shot, 1-shot, and 5-shot settings. However, for 64-shot, Gopher has a higher score than Chinchilla. This suggests that Gopher performs better than Chinchilla when more training data is available during inference, while Chinchilla may have an advantage in scenarios with limited training data.

Based on the table image provided, we can see that for the 0-shot setting, Gopher has a score of around 57.0, while Chinchilla has a score of around 64.1. For the 1-shot and 5-shot settings, Gopher's score is lower than Chinchilla's score, which is consistent with the textual context provided earlier. However, for the 64-shot setting, Gopher's score is higher than Chinchilla's score.

Overall, it appears that Gopher may have an advantage over Chinchilla when there is a large amount of training data available during inference, while Chinchilla may perform better with limited training data.

GPT3 and llama Truthful comparison ,"The table compares the performance of GPT-3 and LLaMA models on the TruthfulQA benchmark, which measures the fraction of truthful and truthfulinformative answers. GPT-3 models with 1.3B, 6B, and 175B parameters show lower performance, with Truthful scores of 0.31, 0.22, and 0.28, and TruthfulInformative scores of 0.19, 0.19, and 0.25, respectively. In contrast, LLaMA models demonstrate superior results, with Truthful scores increasing from 0.33 to 0.57 and Truthful*Informative scores rising from 0.29 to 0.53 as the parameter count grows from 7B to 65B. This suggests that larger LLaMA models provide more truthful and informative answers compared to their GPT-3 counterparts."," From the provided textual context, it can be concluded that LLaMA-I (65B) outperforms GPT code-davinci-002 on MMLU but is still far from state-of-the-art performance of 77.4. The table in the appendix shows the performance of various models on different benchmarks, including MMLU.
